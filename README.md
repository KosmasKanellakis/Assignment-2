# Political Campaign Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment2.ipynb`) that performs a detailed analysis of political resistance campaigns. The analysis uses the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) dataset and the Polity V dataset to explore historical trends, factors influencing campaign success, and the dynamics of nonviolent resistance.

## Prerequisites

To run the analysis yourself, you will need the following:

### Data Files
The following files must be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the notebook:
- `NAVCO 1.2 Updated.tab`
- `p5v2018.xls`

### Python Libraries
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy statsmodels openpyxl
```

## Analysis and Findings

The notebook is divided into five sections, each addressing a specific research question.

### 1. Exploration of Historical Trends

This section visualizes the historical evolution of resistance campaigns.
- **Frequency of Campaigns:** A stacked area chart shows the frequency of nonviolent and violent campaigns, grouped by the decade of their conclusion. It visualizes the rise of nonviolent campaigns in recent decades.
- **Nonviolent Campaign Trends:** A dual-axis bar chart displays both the total number of nonviolent campaigns and their corresponding success rate for each decade since the 1940s.
- **Success Rate Comparison:** A bar chart compares the success rates of violent versus nonviolent campaigns by decade, consistently showing that nonviolent campaigns have a higher probability of success.

### 2. Largest Resistance Campaigns (1946-2014)

This analysis identifies and visualizes the largest resistance campaigns based on popular participation.
- A horizontal bar plot illustrates all campaigns that mobilized at least 2% of the population at their peak.
- The bars are color-coded to distinguish between successful, failed, and partially successful campaigns.
- A campaign from Greece is also included and specifically highlighted for investigation.

### 3. The Effect of Participation on the Probability of Campaign Success

This section uses logistic regression to model the relationship between public participation and the likelihood of a campaign's success.
- **Model 1 (With Controls):** A logistic regression is run to predict success based on logged participants per capita, controlling for the location's logged population. The results show that participation is a statistically significant positive predictor of success, while population size has a minor negative effect.
- **Model 2 (Simple Model):** A second regression is run using only logged participants per capita as the predictor.
- **Comparison:** The notebook explains the differences between the two models and uses scatter plots to visualize the predicted probability of success against the level of participation for each model.

### 4. The Level of Participation Tipping Point

This section investigates the "3.5% rule," a well-known finding from the research suggesting a participation threshold for campaign success.
- **Chenoweth's Rule:** A table is generated by binning campaigns based on their peak popular participation percentage. This table shows the number of campaigns and the success rate for each bin. The results strongly support the 3.5% rule, showing that campaigns surpassing this threshold achieve a success rate of nearly 89%.
- **Statistical Tipping Point:** Using the logistic regression model from the previous section, the analysis calculates the participation level required to achieve a 99% probability of success, identifying a statistically derived "tipping point."

### 5. Nonviolent Resistance and Target Regime Type

The final section examines whether the effectiveness of nonviolent resistance holds true after controlling for the political nature of the target regime.
- **Data Merging:** The NAVCO dataset is merged with the Polity V dataset, which contains scores for regime types.
- **Comprehensive Logistic Regression:** A logistic regression model is fitted to predict success based on four variables:
    1.  `NONVIOL`: An indicator for nonviolent campaigns.
    2.  `polity2`: The target regime's Polity V score.
    3.  `LOG_PARTICIPATION_PER_CAPITA`: The logged participation per capita.
    4.  `LOG_POPULATION`: The logged population of the location.
- **Findings:** The results indicate that the `NONVIOL` indicator remains a strong, statistically significant predictor of success, even after accounting for regime type, participation levels, and population size.
